## <a name="desc"></a> Description

The Apereo Weather Portlet is a fully-functional JSR-286 Java portlet that provides
international weather using either World Weather Online or Yahoo Weather. If permitted,
end users have the ability add and delete multiple locations and standards of measurement
with ease!

The Weather Portlet has been bundled with uPortal since 3.2.0.

## <a name="config"></a> Configuration

### <a name="locations"></a> Weather Locations

The default weather service is [Yahoo! Weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/).
Weather locations are most commonly configured by the portal developer/administrator
using portlet preferences. **Currently this method does not require an API key.**

#### Example Weather Locations Configuration:

``` xml
<portlet-preference>
    <name>locationCodes</name>
    <value>2459115</value>
    <value>1118370</value>
</portlet-preference>
<portlet-preference>
    <name>locations</name>
    <value>New York, NY</value>
    <value>Tokyo, Japan(Tokyo)</value>
</portlet-preference>
<portlet-preference>
    <name>units</name>
    <value>F</value>
    <value>C</value>
</portlet-preference>
<portlet-preference>
    <name>showEditLink</name>
    <value>false</value>
</portlet-preference>
```

You can discover `locationCodes` for your locations by inspecting the URL of the
associated page in Yahoo! Weather.  For example, the following URL belongs to the
Yahoo! Weather page for Phoenix, AZ:

  - <https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/united-states/arizona/phoenix-2471390/>

The location code for Phoenix is 2471390.

### <a name="yahoo!"></a> Yahoo! Weather API Key

The Apereo Weather Portlet includes an optional EDIT mode that allows end users to
manage their own weather locations.  To use it, you must provide a valid API key
from developer.yahoo.com.

To obtain an API key, you must [Create an App](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create)
in the Yahoo! Developer Network portal.  Once you create your app, copy the
`Client Secret (Consumer Secret)` that Yahoo! generates.

Paste the `Client Secret` in the space provided within
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/context/applicationContext.xml`:

``` xml
<!--
    Yahoo! Weather DAO Implementation
-->

<bean id="weatherDaoImpl" class="org.jasig.portlet.weather.dao.yahoo.YahooWeatherDaoImpl">
    <property name="key" value=""/> <!--  ENTER YOUR KEY HERE -->
    <property name="weatherParsingService" ref="weatherParsingService"/>
    <property name="locationParsingService" ref="locationParsingService"/>
    <property name="messageSource" ref="messageSource"/>
</bean>
```

As with all portlets, you must package and deploy a new build of the Weather Portlet
for this change to take effect.
